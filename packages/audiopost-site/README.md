## Gatsby

The web client is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Gatsby uses several tools under the hood—[Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and more—and provides a central point of configuration in the `gatsby-config` file. Explore the [Gatsby plugin library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/) for a list of possible integrations.

## React

The web client uses the [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library to encourage declarative and component-based programming. [Component composition](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html) is encouraged to maximize component reuse. Visit the [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs) for more concepts and best-practices.
