# Development Environment

## npm

This project uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as its package manager, software registry, and monorepo utility. Because it requires [workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) introduced in version 7, ensure that you are using at minimum npm version 7 included in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 15. Ease of upgrade depends on your [installation method](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

### Lock files

`package-lock.json` files are excluded from version control by default in `.gitignore`. Lock files should be preserved for applications and may be overridden with the following pattern.

```gitignore
# Per workspace
!workspace/*/package-lock.json

# Per package
!workspace/pkgname/package-lock.json
```

## Git

This project uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as its version control system.

### gitignore

Only files and patterns that are generated by the build system belong in `.gitignore`. Backup or temporary files generated by the editor belong in the user's `~/.gitignore` as recommended in the [git docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

## GitHub

This project uses [GitHub](https://github.com/) as its distributed version control host. Access the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ryantoddgarza/audiopost).
